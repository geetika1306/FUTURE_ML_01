📌 Internship: Future Interns

Track: Machine Learning (ML)
Task: Task 1 – AI-Powered Sales Forecasting
Repository: FUTURE_ML_01

🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered sales forecasting system using historical retail sales data.
The goal is to analyze past sales trends and predict future sales using time-series forecasting techniques.
The solution leverages Facebook Prophet, a robust forecasting model designed for handling trends and seasonality in time-series data.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains daily retail sales information with the following columns:
Column Name	Description
data	Date of sale
venda	Number of items sold
estoque	Stock available
preco	Product price

For forecasting, only:
Date (data)
Sales (venda)
were used.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Prophet
Platform: Google Colab

⚙️ Methodology

Cleaned and formatted the data for time-series analysis
Converted data into Prophet-compatible format (ds, y)
Trained a Prophet forecasting model
Generated future sales predictions

Visualized:
Historical sales trends
Forecasted sales
Trend and seasonality components

📈 Results & Visualizations

The model successfully:
Identified overall sales trends
Captured seasonal patterns
Predicted future sales for the next 30 days

Visual outputs include:
